Implement Prim and Kruskal algorithms for minimum spanning trees that were
discussed in class.  Implement take 1 of Prim that uses a priority queue
of edges.  Starter code is provided.

The methods that you will need to complete are the following:

1. public static MST kruskal(Graph g): implementation of Kruskal's algorithm.

2. public static MST prim(Graph g, Vertex s): implementation of Prim's algorithm.

To implement the above methods, you will need to modify MSTVertex class by
adding fields to store the attributes of vertices in the algorithms.
In addition, you may add helper methods to MST and MSTVertex classes, as needed.
If you need additional classes, define them as nested classes of MST.
Do not create additional Java files.
